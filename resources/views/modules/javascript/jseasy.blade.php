                <h2 style="text-align:left;">What is JavaScript?</h2>
                <br>
<p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language used to make webpages interactive (e.g., having complex animations, clickable buttons, popup menus, etc.). There are also more advanced server side versions of JavaScript such as Node.js, which allow you to add more functionality to a website than downloading files (such as realtime collaboration between multiple computers). Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
<p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
<ul>
                    <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</li>
                    <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</li>
</ul>
<p>This means that in the browser, JavaScript can change the way the webpage (DOM) looks. And, likewise, Node.js JavaScript on the server can respond to custom requests sent by code executed in the browser.</p>
<br>
<h2 style="text-align:left;">What is JavaScript?</h2>
<p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>
<p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.</p>
<p>JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.</p>
<p>Java is a class-based programming language designed for fast execution and type safety. Type safety means, for instance, that you can't cast a Java integer into an object reference or access private memory by corrupting the Java bytecode. Java's class-based model means that programs consist exclusively of classes and their methods. Java's class inheritance and strong typing generally require tightly coupled object hierarchies. These requirements make Java programming more complex than JavaScript programming.</p>
<p>In contrast, JavaScript descends in spirit from a line of smaller, dynamically typed languages such as HyperTalk and dBASE. These scripting languages offer programming tools to a much wider audience because of their easier syntax, specialized built-in functionality, and minimal requirements for object creation.</p>

<h5>JavaScript</h5>
<p>Object-oriented. No distinction between types of objects. Inheritance is through the prototype mechanism, and properties and methods can be added to any object dynamically.
Variable data types are not declared (dynamic typing, loosely typed).
Cannot automatically write to hard disk.</p>
<br>
<h5>java</h5>
<p>Class-based. Objects are divided into classes and instances with all inheritance through the class hierarchy. Classes and instances cannot have properties or methods added dynamically.
Variable data types must be declared (static typing, strongly typed).
Can automatically write to hard disk.</p>
<br>
<p>JavaScript borrows most of its syntax from Java, C, and C++, but it has also been influenced by Awk, Perl, and Python.</p>
<br>
<p>JavaScript is case-sensitive and uses the Unicode character set. For example, the word Früh (which means "early" in German) could be used as a variable name.</p>

<p>JS<br>const Früh = "foobar";</p>
<p>But, the variable früh is not the same as Früh because JavaScript is case sensitive.<br><br>

In JavaScript, instructions are called statements and are separated by semicolons (;).<br><br>

A semicolon is not necessary after a statement if it is written on its own line. But if more than one statement on a line is desired, then they must be separated by semicolons.</p>

<p>It is considered best practice, however, to always write a semicolon after a statement, even when it is not strictly needed. This practice reduces the chances of bugs getting into the code.</p>
<p>The source text of JavaScript script gets scanned from left to right, and is converted into a sequence of input elements which are tokens, control characters, line terminators, comments, or whitespace. (Spaces, tabs, and newline characters are considered whitespace.)</p>
<br>
<h2 style="text-align:left;">Comments</h2>
<p>The syntax of comments is the same as in C++ and in many other languages:</p>
<p>JS<br>// a one line comment<br><br>

/* this is a longer,<br>
 * multi-line comment<br>
 */
</p>
<p>You can't nest block comments. This often happens when you accidentally include a */ sequence in your comment, which will terminate the comment.</p>
<p>JS<br>/* You can't, however, /* nest comments */ SyntaxError */
</p>
<p>In this case, you need to break up the */ pattern. For example, by inserting a backslash:</p>
<p>JS<br>/* You can /* nest comments *\/ by escaping slashes */
</p>
<p>Comments behave like whitespace, and are discarded during script execution.</p>
<br>
<h2 style="text-align:left;">Declarations</h2>
<p>JavaScript has three kinds of variable declarations.</p>
<p>var: Declares a variable, optionally initializing it to a value.</p>
<p>let: Declares a block-scoped, local variable, optionally initializing it to a value.</p>
<p>const: Declares a block-scoped, read-only named constant.</p>
<p>Variables: You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.</p>
<p>A JavaScript identifier usually starts with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($). Subsequent characters can also be digits (0 – 9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters A through Z (uppercase) as well as a through z (lowercase).</p>
<p>You can use most Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. (For more details, see the lexical grammar reference.) You can also use Unicode escape sequences to represent characters in identifiers.</p>
<p>Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, $credit, and _name.</p>
<h5>Declaring variables</h5>
<p>You can declare a variable in two ways:</p>
<ul>
                    <li>With the keyword var. For example, var x = 42. This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables, depending on the execution context.</li>
                    <li>With the keyword const or let. For example, let y = 13. This syntax can be used to declare a block-scope local variable. (See Variable scope below.)</li>
</ul>
<p>You can declare variables to unpack values using the destructuring assignment syntax. For example, const { bar } = foo. This will create a variable named bar and assign to it the value corresponding to the key of the same name from our object foo.</p>
<p>Variables should always be declared before they are used. JavaScript used to allow assigning to undeclared variables, which creates an undeclared global variable. This is an error in strict mode and should be avoided altogether.</p>
<h5>Declaration and initialization</h5>
<p>In a statement like let x = 42, the let x part is called a declaration, and the = 42 part is called an initializer. The declaration allows the variable to be accessed later in code without throwing a ReferenceError, while the initializer assigns a value to the variable. In var and let declarations, the initializer is optional. If a variable is declared without an initializer, it is assigned the value undefined.</p>
<p>JS<br>let x;<br>
console.log(x); // logs "undefined"<br>
et x; </p>
<p>In essence, let x = 42 is equivalent to let x; x = 42.<br>

const declarations always need an initializer, because they forbid any kind of assignment after declaration, and implicitly initializing it with undefined is likely a programmer mistake.
</p>
<p>JS<br>const x; // SyntaxError: Missing initializer in const declaration</p>
